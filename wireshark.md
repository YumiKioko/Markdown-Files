# Wireshark Cheat Sheet

**Wireshark** is a powerful, open-source network protocol analyzer that captures and interactively analyzes network traffic in real time.

---

## 🚀 Installation

### Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install wireshark
```

### RedHat/CentOS:

```bash
sudo dnf install wireshark-gtk
```

### macOS:

```bash
brew install wireshark
```

---

## 🖥️ Starting Wireshark

- GUI: Just run `wireshark`
- TUI (terminal): Use `tshark`

```bash
sudo wireshark
```

---

## 🎯 Capture Filters vs Display Filters

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Capture Filter** | Before packet capture | `tcp port 80` |
| **Display Filter** | After capture (analysis) | `http.request.method == "GET"` |

---

## 🎛️ Common Capture Filters

```bash
host 192.168.1.1           # Traffic to/from host
net 192.168.1.0/24         # Traffic in subnet
port 443                   # All HTTPS traffic
tcp                        # All TCP packets
udp port 53                # DNS queries
not arp                    # Ignore ARP
```

---

## 🔍 Common Display Filters

### Protocols:

```bash
http
dns
tcp
icmp
ftp
ssl || tls
```

### IP Address Filtering:

```bash
ip.addr == 10.0.0.1
ip.src == 192.168.1.5
ip.dst == 8.8.8.8
```

### TCP:

```bash
tcp.port == 80
tcp.flags.syn == 1 && tcp.flags.ack == 0     # SYN packets
tcp.analysis.retransmission
```

### HTTP:

```bash
http.request.method == "GET"
http.host == "example.com"
http.set_cookie
http.authorization
```

### DNS:

```bash
dns.qry.name == "google.com"
dns.flags.rcode != 0
```

### Credentials:

```bash
ftp.request.command == "PASS"
http.authorization
```

## 📂 Follow Streams

### Follow TCP stream:

- Right-click on a TCP packet → "Follow" → "TCP Stream"

### Useful for:

- Viewing HTTP requests
- Extracting credentials or file transfers
- Analyzing full conversations

---

## 📈 Analyze → Protocol Hierarchy

View breakdown of all captured protocols and their percentage.

---

## 📤 Export Objects

**File → Export Objects → HTTP / SMB / DICOM / TFTP**

Used to extract files transferred over the network.

---

## 🛠 Useful Features

- **Color Rules**: Highlight packets by protocol or flag
- **Statistics → Conversations**: Analyze flows between hosts
- **Name Resolution**: Resolve IPs to hostnames
  - `View → Name Resolution → Enable for MAC/DNS`

---

## 🧰 Command-Line (tshark)

```bash
sudo tshark -i wlan0 -f "port 80" -w capture.pcap
```

### Display with filter:

```bash
tshark -r capture.pcap -Y "http"
```

---

## 🧪 Packet Dissection Example

```http
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable.site
Authorization: Basic dXNlcjpwYXNz
```

- `Authorization` header = base64 → credentials
- `Follow TCP Stream` shows entire HTTP conversation

---

## 🧱 Pro Tips

- Use filters to reduce noise (especially `ip.addr`, `http`, `dns`)
- Use color coding to spot anomalies
- Use `tshark` for automation or scripting

---

## ⚖️ Legal Notice

Capturing traffic without **explicit authorization** is **illegal and unethical**. Only use Wireshark on networks you **own** or have **permission** to monitor.
